          I am a software developer with a passion for learning and creating
          software. I have a Bachelor's degree in Control and Automation
          Engineering. I have a Master's degree in Techonology of Sustentable
          Processes. I have experience in web development and desktop
          development. I am currently working as a full stack developer at a
          startup in Florian√≥polis, SC, Brazil, where I currently live.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a self-taught programmer. In college I learned the fundamentals
          of Computer Science and programming languages such as C, C++, Java,
          and SQL. I learned Python, and for my final papers, I also learned
          Matlab on my own. Those works resulted in three desktop softwares that
          were registered. So after graduation from my masters I started
          learning web development. I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my
          own.
        </p>

        <p>
          I found that I really enjoyed web development, so I started learning
          Django, React and Ruby on Rails on my own. I participated in an
          educational program for Full Stack Developer beginners called Hiring
          Coders in which I was a finalist, one of 300 out of 10,000 parcipants.
          But it wasn't until I started working at my current job that I
          deepened into React and also learned Elixir. Since then I've been
          working with React and Elixir for personal and work projects.
